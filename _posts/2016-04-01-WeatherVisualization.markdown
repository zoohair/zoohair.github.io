title: Data Analysis Tool for Flyable Days
venue: Kitty Hawk, 2016
authors: Z. Mahboubi

  Using Beautiful Soup, I scrapped weather data relevant to aeronautical operations (winds, temperatures, clouds, rainfall, etc.) for different locations.<br>
  I computed cumulative histrograms, and linked the different criteria to each other. Then using an interactive display (built on Bokeh), I made it possible to adjust criteria to determine the number of flyable days for each location, and visualize the sensitivity to the different parameters.
