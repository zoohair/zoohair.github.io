description: |
  As one of the early employees of Zee.Aero (now <a href="https://cora.aero">cora.aero</a>), I participated in the design, construction, aerodynamic and stability analysis, control synthesis, and flight testing of the proof of concept for eVTOL vehicle. This included working on subscale models, both in free flight but also inside of a windtunnel.
